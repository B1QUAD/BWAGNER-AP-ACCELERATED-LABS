This is a github repository in which I post my solutions to Barry Wagner's AP Accelerated computer science labs that he teaches at Denton High School in Denton, Tx. The lab prompts can be found at his website bwagner.org. 

**These solutions are ment to educate and not serve as an outlet for cheating, if your teacher uses these labs as tests or graded assignments please refrain from using these resources as copying and pasting the source code will not teach you anything.**

If you have any questions regarding how this source code works please open an issue on this GitHub repository.
