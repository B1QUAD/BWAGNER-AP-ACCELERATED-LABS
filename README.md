**These solutions are meant to educate and not serve as an outlet for cheating. If your teacher uses these labs as tests or graded assignments please refrain from using these solutions since copying and pasting the code will not teach you anything.**

This is a GitHub repository in which I post my solutions to Barry Wagner's AP Accelerated computer science labs that he teaches at Denton High School in Denton, Tx. The lab prompts can be found on his website bwagner.org. 

If you have any questions regarding how this source code works please open an issue on this GitHub repository.
